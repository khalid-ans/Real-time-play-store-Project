 Internship Report 

   1. Introduction 
I am Md Khalid working as Data Analyst Intern. This report summarizes my internship experience, focusing on the analysis of Google Play Store data. The project involved processing and visualizing app data to derive meaningful insights about app ratings, user reviews, revenue, and global trends.

 

   2. Background 
The internship aimed to enhance my technical skills in data analysis and visualization. By analyzing datasets related to app performance, user sentiment, and market trends, I gained a deeper understanding of data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization techniques.

 

   3. Learning Objectives 
- Develop proficiency in Python libraries for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy).
- Gain hands-on experience with visualization tools (Plotly).
- Understand data preprocessing, including cleaning and transformation.
- Perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
- Build interactive dashboards for data visualization.

 

   4. Activities and Tasks 
-  Data Cleaning:  Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
-  Data Transformation:  Converted categorical and numerical data for analysis.
-  Sentiment Analysis:  Used NLTK's Vader to assess user sentiments.
-  Visualization:  Created interactive charts (e.g., bar plots, pie charts, scatter plots) using Plotly.
-  Dashboard Development:  Generated HTML dashboards for dynamic visualization.
-  Task Automation:  Streamlined processes for scaling data and grouping metrics.

 

   5. Skills and Competencies 
-  Technical Skills:  Python, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, NLTK, and HTML integration.
-  Analytical Thinking:  Analyzing trends and correlations in data.
-  Communication:  Presenting findings through clear visualizations and insights.

 

   6. Feedback and Evidence 
Evidence of my work includes the generation of visualizations like:
- Top app categories by installs.
- Rating distributions.
- Revenue analysis by category.
- Sentiment analysis of user reviews.

The insights derived were well-received for their clarity and relevance to market trends.

 

   7. Challenges and Solutions 
-  Challenge:  Problem occurred while scaling the millions into plot
  -  Solution:  Used StandardScaler function to scale the data and to allow the plot to be displayed properly.
-  Challenge:  Visualizing complex data relationships on dashboard within timeframe for fig11 to fig14.
  -  Solution:  It has taken some days to implement the logic of javascript to manage the timeframe appearance of plots.
 -Challenge: While deploying on netlify ,web hosting error encountered .
  Solution : It was due to uploading the folder without zipping it.


 

   8. Outcomes and Impact 
-Created the dashboard which includes a comprehensive understanding of app market trends.
- Enhanced technical expertise in data processing and visualization.
- Created reusable scripts and dashboards for further analysis.
 

   9. Conclusion 
This internship provided a robust foundation in data analytics and visualization. The practical exposure to real-world datasets and analytical tools has significantly enriched my knowledge and skills.
